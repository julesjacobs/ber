# Agent guidelines

After completing a task, notify the user about what you completed using the macos `say` command.

Keep track of your tasks using TODO.md. For complex tasks, first make a plan in TODO.md and then check off the tasks one by one. Periodically review if your plan is still good, and potentially update it to improve it.
